9.3.1 Dwelling house code
9.3.1.1 Application
1.
This code applies to undertaking development for dwelling houses(22) on varying lot types located in the General
residential zone, the Emerging community zone - Transition precinct if on a developed lot, the Redcliffe Kippa-Ring
local plan - Interim residential precinct, and the Caboolture West local plan - Urban living precinct (Next generation
neighbourhood sub-precinct) if on a developed lot, if:
a.
the development has been categorised as either accepted development subject to requirements or
assessable development - code assessment, and this code is identified as applicable to that development
in the assessment benchmarks for assessable development and requirements for accepted development
column of a table of assessment (Part 5);
b.
the development has been categorised as assessable development - impact assessment (Part 5).
2.
For accepted development subject to requirements or assessable development under this Code:
a.
Part A of the code applies only to accepted development subject to requirements;
b.
Part B of the code applies only to assessable development.
9.3.1.2 Purpose
1.
The purpose of the 9.3.1 'Dwelling house code' is to guide development to ensure residential development
creates liveable, safe and attractive living environments that complement the precinct character.
Note - Refer to the overall outcomes for the relevant zone, precinct or sub-precinct to determine the relevant precinct character.
2.
The purpose of the code will be achieved through the following overall outcomes:
a.
Dwelling houses(22) support housing diversity that meets the needs of existing and future residents within
the region.
b.
The character and scale of Dwelling houses(22) are compatible with the intended character for the zone
and precinct.
Note - Refer to the overall outcomes for the relevant zone, precinct or sub-precinct to determine the relevant precinct character.
c.
Secondary dwellings associate with the principal dwelling and remain subordinate and ancillary to the
principal dwelling by:
i.
retaining the low density, low intensity, residential form of a dwelling house(22);
ii.
ensuring the GFA does not exceed:
A.
45m
2 GFA for a lot with a primary frontage less than 15m;
B.
55m
2 GFA for a lot with a primary frontage of 15m or more.
d.
Garages, car ports and domestic outbuildings remain subordinate and ancillary to the principal dwelling
and are located and designed to reduce amenity impacts on adjoining properties and not dominate the
street frontage.

9.3.1.3 Requirements for assessment
If development is to be categorised as accepted development subject to requirements it must comply with the
requirements for accepted development set out in Part A, Table 9.3.1.1. Where the development does not meet a
requirement for accepted development (RAD) within Part A Table 9.3.1.1, the category of development changes to
assessable development under the rules outlined in section 5.3.3. (1), and assessment is against the corresponding
performance outcome (PO) identified in the table below. This only occurs whenever a RAD is not met, and is
therefore limited to the subject matter of the RADs that are not complied with. To remove any doubt, for those RADs
that are complied with, there is no need for assessment against the corresponding PO.

Where accepted development subject to requirements cannot comply with one or more of the requirements for accepted
development listed as concurrence agency issues, Council will be a Concurrence Agency for assessment of those
aspects of a Development Application for Building Works. Noncompliance will be assessed by Council against the
corresponding applicable performance outcomes in Part B Requirements for assessable development. Noncompliance
with a requirement for a concurrence agency issue does not change the categories of development or categories of
assessment. Where the Dwelling house(22) does not comply with one or more of the requirements for accepted
development relating to a constraint, the development becomes assessable development - code assessment and an
application will be required to be lodged with Council in accordance with the section 5.3.3(1)(a)(ii).

Editor's note - See in heading above for other uses excluded from native vegetation clearing requirements.
Editor's note - Where vegetation clearance is accepted development subject to requirements, care should be undertaken to
avoid adverse impacts on koalas, koala habitat values and habitat connectivity and to encourage existing koala usage of the
site. Measures to minimise impacts include:
i.
co-locating all associated activities, infrastructure and access strips;
ii.
be the least valued area of koala habitat on the site;
iii.
minimise the footprint of the development envelope area;
iv.
minimise edge effects to areas external to the development envelope;
v.
location and design consideration to ensure koala safety and movement in accordance with the Koala-sensitive Design
Guideline and Planning scheme policy – Environmental areas;
vi.
sufficient area between the development and koala habitat trees to achieve their long-term viability.
Editor's note - Where vegetation clearing is accepted development subject to requirements, consideration should be given to
avoid clearing habitat trees. Habitat trees may contain structural hollows where animals live, breed and shelter. The provision
of nest boxes or salvaging of hollows will provide compensatory roosting and nesting opportunities for local wildlife including
sugar gliders, possums and owls. For further information see Planning scheme policy – Environmental areas.
No clearing of native vegetation is to occur within the Value Offset Area MLES - Waterway buffer or
Value Offset Area MLES - Wetland buffer.
